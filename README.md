## DFW1N Open Source Intelligence List Australia

## Description:

Conduct background checks on employees or find a missing person that will assist the government finding people. The goal of this repository is to provide information or ideas to assist in your OSINT investigation on your target. This repository will provide you with many ideas and information to conduct a thorough search.

A reminder that this list is still currently being developed and is built on OSINT gathering tools to scrape the clear web and deep web for information. This list was designed to assist cyber professionals and ethical hackers for the AustCyber Canberra Innovation Node that partnered with the Australian Federal Police, the `National `Missing Persons Coordination Centre, and Trace Labs to conduct a missing persons event. The purpose of this list is to ensure it is easier to find OSINT on Australians that have gone missing. This list can also be used for many other purposes beyond OSINT.

## [â†‘](#contents) Introduction

I have created this for the purposes of Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) Gathering. This is a guide and cheat sheet you can use to speed up your process for background checks, employee information scraping, missing person searches, and much more. This list would benefit:

- Government Agencies
- Recruiting Officers
- Employees
- Managers
- Police Services
- Intelligence Services

... and more. This has been targeted towards OSINT specifically in Australia.

Start by downloading a OSINT Operating System (OS), create burner accounts for all social media platforms so you do not use your real information as some services could alert your target to your investigation. Use a VPN when conducting OSINT investigations, but **do not use a free VPN - they are an information security risk.**

## [â†‘](#contents) Radio/Signal Broadcasts

Many Australian radio and signal feeds are streamed and/or archived across the web. For example, the ACT's emergency services broadcast feed and its archives can be found here:

- https://www.broadcastify.com/listen/feed/41421

These feeds can be incredibly useful. The ABC used this particular feed to [time the emergency response](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-08-01/how-abc-exposed-communications-breakdown-orroral-valley-fire/100340210) to the Namadgi bushfire in January 2020.

## [â†‘](#contents) Aerial Imagery

Beyond satellite data from providers like MODIS, Australian jurisdictions often release aerial imagery and other geospatial data through public GIS servers (often running ArcGIS behind the scenes).

Geoscience Australia has a vast online collection of historic aerial imagery that is available for free access:

- [Geoscience Australia](https://geoscience-au.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=06161d013fe645e2bccfd8e961b0e212)

Other providers include State/Territory governments themselves. The ACT and NSW governments both provide ArcGIS access to historic and current(ish) aerial imagery:

- [NSW](https://portal.spatial.nsw.gov.au/portal/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=f7c215b873864d44bccddda8075238cb)
- [ACT mapi](https://apps.vertigisstudio.com/web/?app=8e7485a3d9a54f038682e1cb00cd7a31)

## [â†‘](#contents) Transport

### Flights

Like pretty much anywhere else in the world, you can track Australian airlines and flights with flight trackers like [Flightradar24](https://www.flightradar24.com/).

### Public Transport

Many jurisdictions have open data feeds that provide current or near-current information about public transport systems. The ACT has a data feed for their ACTION buses as well as live data feeds for their tram system. More information canb e found [here](https://www.transport.act.gov.au/contact-us/information-for-developers). If you have access to the Google Maps API, you can get a general interface into most jurisdictions' transport systems where Google has already done the API integration work for you. More info can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key).

## [â†‘](#contents) Courts and Tribunal Hearings

Most courts in Australia are open, meaning the public is allowed to know about who each hearing is for, and can visit the court (or in some cases dial in remotely) to watch/listen to the hearing's proceedings.

NSW provides a central list for all court cases. If you can pass a CAPTCHA, you can access them all:

- https://districtcourt.nsw.gov.au/court-lists-and-sitting-dates/types-of-court-lists.html

The ACT does the same (pretty easy, as it only has 2 courts beyond the Childrens Court):

- https://www.courts.act.gov.au/coming-to-court/lists

Some other jurisdictions like Queensland make the process a bit harder, where some local/magistrate courts (e.g., Toowoomba) have their own websites with their own hearing list system. These can range from well-maintained to copy-and-pasted-PDF to non-existing levels of accessibility:

- https://www.courts.qld.gov.au/__external/CourtsLawList/ToowoombaCourt.pdf

The Federal courts (including the High Court) provide regularly updated hearing lists:

- https://www.hcourt.gov.au/registry/court-lists
- https://www.fedcourt.gov.au/court-calendar/daily-court-lists (per-jurisdiction)

## [â†‘](#contents) Tenders and Contracts

Each government around Australia contracts out certain activities to private third parties. Tenders (proposals for this work) and contracts (agreements between 3rd parties and the government to complete the work and constraints, etc.) are publicly available to different degrees depending on jurisdiction. The Commonwealth's one-stop shop for contracts and tenders is [AusTender](https://www.tenders.gov.au/). Each state and territory provides their contract listings to varying degrees of accessibility.

- [ACT](https://www.procurement.act.gov.au/registers/contracts-register)
- [NSW](https://www.tenders.nsw.gov.au/)
- [QLD](https://qtenders.epw.qld.gov.au/)
- [SA](https://www.tenders.sa.gov.au/)
- [WA](https://www.tenders.wa.gov.au/watenders/index.do)
- [NT](https://www.nt.gov.au/tenders)
- [TAS](https://www.purchasing.tas.gov.au/winning-government-business/finding-business/finding-opportunities/current-tenders)

Contracts and tenders, and surrounding media reports, can help paint a picture of _why_ certain decisions were made and can be full of information relevant to an investigation.
